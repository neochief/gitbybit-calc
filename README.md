# iOS Calculator App

[This is a part of the Git practice on GitByBit](https://gitbybit.com/) | [Working Demo](https://neochief.github.io/gitbybit-calc/)

For the sake of this practice session, we will try to mimic iOS calculator app with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as close as possible.

We will start by creating a visual representation of the calculator app using HTML and CSS. Then we will add functionality to the calculator using JavaScript.
